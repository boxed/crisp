               This is a sample session of the WINDOWS NT fight.
               -------------------------------------------------

The windows NT CSERVE support had a hard time answering my questions. All together 25
quections posted, many of them with a multiple bounce type of communcation like .. did you do this, or do you have that etc..

The progress we made was a collaboration of several departments. Of course it was slower then ideal. To give you a taste of how real the questions were, please read the following sample of correspondence.

REQUEST TO CSERVE:

Problems on compiling a device driver.

I have the following config:
----------------------------
i486 50Mhz, IDE 420 MB * 2, 16 Mbyte RAM
NT 3.5, DDK MSDN october 1994, VC 2.0 for NT

When I compile (BUILD) a sample device driver, all seems to be O.K.
By just renaming the files I get into trouble.

The following error pops up:

                           BUILD.EXE
                Access violation at 0x01004768
                Cannot access memory at memory at 0x00000000

Which looks like a NULL pointer access. I cannot continue with my work.
I have tried he folloing combinations:

GENPORT (for simplicity) NT 3.1, VC1.10, VC 2.00, DDK jun, DDK oct
GENPORT (for simplicity) NT 3.5, VC 2.00, DDK oct
with the same result.

I cannot continue with my work. I need to produce an a2d device driver, hooked on the parallel port. I am late, and out of company schedule.

Please help.

Peter Glen Atlanta.

ANSWER FROM CSERVE:

Hi Peter,

you even have problems to build GENPORT using NT 3.1 + VC/NT 1.10 + NT 3.1-DDK (from June-MSDN) ?

This is a configuration we're using to build NT-Device-Drivers for months without problems. We know problems if you're using:
 - NT 3.1 + VC/NT 1.10 + NT 3.5-DDK (from Oct-MSDN)
 - NT 3.5 + VC/NT 1.10
.. and we didn't use the Retail-Version of MSVC 2.0 til now (still using a BETA), due to a lack of time<g>.

But, you're saying the problems occured after RENAMING files even in the
configuration that's working well at our site.
BTW, our hardware-base is similar to yours. Can you tell we
(based on the GENPORT-sample) what exactly led you into problems


(renaming which files to which names)?

I hope I can help you ..

If you are in pinch for time you might want to look at our toolkit,WinRT. No-one gets through the NT DDK without putting in some very significant time.

WinRT allows a Win32 program to perform Port I/O, Memory I/O and Interrupt handling withou the DDK. The toolkit takes very little time to come up to speed on.
If you would like further info e-mail a ground address or Fax number.

ANSWER FROM CSERVE:

I tried to duplicate your problem, but could not.  When I want to build a
quick sample, I usually copy one of the DDK samples, rename the files, modify
the code as needed, and build the driver.  I've never seen the problem you
are experiencing.

Did you also edit the files to change the "#include ..." files?  You might
try renaming the files to a different name (possible name conflict?).

You might also might want to insure that you are using the correct version
of nmake, build, etc.  Type "where nmake.exe" and see where the path is for
this program.  The preferred order is as follows:

\msvc20\bin
\ddk\bin
\mstools\bin

When you try the build, use the "build -cef" command to force the build
program to rebuild all the objects.
