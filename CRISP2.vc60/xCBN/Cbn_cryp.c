   Description:     Implementation of MARX CRYPTO BOX Library.

   Based on the:    Einbindung der cbn .. see below ...

   Procedures:      SEE the comment after the header.

   Notes:           This code is IDENTICAL of Cb9 WATCOM binding codes.
                    The only change is made are in the header Cb9.h

   Reference:       It calls the assembler subroutine Cb9

   Name of library: Cb9MSC6
